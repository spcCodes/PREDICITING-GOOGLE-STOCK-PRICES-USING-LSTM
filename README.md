# PREDICITING-GOOGLE-STOCK-PRICES-USING-LSTM
In this project we will try to predict the stock price of Google using LSTM. Though the future stock price does not depend on the past, but we can observe some trend. We will try to predict the upward and downward trend that exist in Google stocks and this would be done using LSTM (a special case of RNN's). We are going to implement a robust LSTM with stacked layers. We are also going to add drop outs and regularizers to avoid overfitting. \
